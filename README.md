Global Time: A C# World Clock Application

The Global Time is a simple yet highly functional application developed in C#, designed to display the current time across various major cities and time zones around the world, including Moscow, New York, London, Tokyo, and Sydney. It features an intuitive AM/PM time format, making it easy for anyone to read and understand.

This application is open for anyone to use. Whether you're a traveler trying to keep track of time zones, a remote worker coordinating with international teams, or simply someone curious about the time in different parts of the world, the Global Time Tracker is tailored for you.

I developed this project in my free time as a way to challenge myself and to contribute something useful to the community.
